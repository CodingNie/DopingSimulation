# Proposal for Simulating the Calcination Process for Boron and Nitrogen Co-Doped Carbon in LiFePO4

This repository hosts a comprehensive proposal, a research paper for the project "Simulating the Calcination Process for Boron and Nitrogen Co-Doped Carbon in Lithium-Ion Battery Cathode Materials LiFePO4". This project is for CSCI 596 course, is conceptualized by Ning Nie and serves as preliminary research aimed at conceiving the modeling of this complex problem.

## Project Overview

The project proposes a series of computational models to simulate and understand the calcination process in doping LiFePO4 with boron and nitrogen. It covers various computational techniques including Density Functional Theory (DFT), Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, and thermodynamic and kinetic modeling, providing a theoretical framework for future programming and experimental work.
